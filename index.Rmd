# Wagon

            1. 
## Mission Raftaar to enhance the speed potential of all wagons

- 25 variants of wagons tested and 18 variants achieved desired speed in empty/loaded conditions.

- 7 varients (incl BCNAM1, BCNM1, BCNHSM1, BTPN, BOBRNM1, BFNS22.9, and BOBRM1 ) Oscillation trials results analysed with dynamic simulation using NUCARS using recent track profile data.\n
Accordingly modified suspension finalised and springs manufactured for oscillation trials.

- Wagon Directorate successfully validated dynamic characteristics of all the planned wagonsto speed potential to 100Kmp in over 36 oscillation trials. Resulted in 54 major variants of wagons constituting about 60% of wagons population to 100 Kmph speed.  \n
A summary sheet enclosed as Annexure-A. 


- In 2017-18, only 9 variants of wagons constituting 36% of  wagon population were fit upto 100 Kmph

# Vendor Development in RDSO

- RDSO  streamlined vendor development
- Transparent vendor develpment system with complete ease of doing business on UVAM Portal
- All specification/STR/Drawings/photos and all information necessary for vendor registration on  UVAM website. 
- Waived all testing charges for vendors in RDSO Labs



- Time bound promptness in disposal of the vendor cases \n
This is reflected in the following achievements:

background-size: contain

1.	First time less than 100 cases of vendor registration are pending for disposal with RDSO at the end of Dec’22 as against 232 cases at the end of Dec’22.


2.	The average time for disposal of vendor registration cases in RDSO is less now than 3 months (88 days). All cases are disposed of in 4 months (only 6 exceptional cases are over 4 months but are still within 6 months). All out efforts are being made to further reduce the time for disposal.


3. 	RDSO has substantially decontrolled items and as on date only 209 items are controlled by RDSO as against 406 items in Dec’21. Further efforts are being made to identify and reduce the items


4. With the active engagement to develop vendors especially for the items having less source, the total items with less than 3 vendors have now reduced to 6 in Dec’22 as against 29 items in Dec'21.

## Inspection and Logistics (Mechanical)

1. Quantity of Wagon Production final inspection for railways and private wagon builders during Jan’22 to Dec’22 16633 as against 11174 that Jan’21 to Dec’21.

2. Inspection calls attended 17282 nos. with Inspection value of ₹ 7352 Crores during Jan’22 to Dec’22 as against 23551 Calls with Inspection value of ₹10045- during Jan’21 to Dec’21.

3. A country wide Joint verification exercise at the major depots of the Railways were organised jointly with the Railways covering over 65 major depots/sick-lines/workshops for reconciliation of warranty claims with respect to EM Pads & coupler components involving more than 35 SSEs/Officers of field units. This proved helpful in liquidation of warranty replacement of Railways long pending with various firms.
